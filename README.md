# Commander

_The most flexible and powerfull command line parser for Go._ – Wheel Reinventors ®

Another command line parser for Go.


## Why

The biggest sin of most command line parser is to be tie to the program arguments which make them unusable for other use cases.

This command line parser aim to:
 - allow usage outside of the traditional command line parsing
 - support subcommands
 - pass calling context data
 - provide autocomplete
 - provide bash-completion
